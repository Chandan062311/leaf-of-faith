# 🌿 Leaf of Faith 🌱

Leaf of Faith is an innovative framework designed to monitor and protect endangered plant species in the Western Ghats, a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot. By leveraging advanced technologies like Spring Boot, Semantic Web, and SPARQL queries, this platform provides conservationists with real-time data, empowering them to take effective action against habitat destruction and biodiversity loss.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The unrelenting loss of forests and biodiversity in the Western Ghats calls for a modern solution. Leaf of Faith is built to:
- Monitor endangered plant species and their habitats in real-time
- Provide actionable insights using data-driven methods
- Empower NGOs and environmentalists with a centralized platform for collaboration and data access

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-Time Flora Monitoring**: Track at-risk species and habitat health with precision.
- **SPARQL-Powered Data Queries**: Efficiently access detailed information on plant species and their ecosystems.
- **Spring Boot Backend**: Ensures scalability, high performance, and modular architecture.
- **REST API Integration**: Enables seamless communication between front-end and back-end.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed with React.js for easy navigation and accessibility.

## 🛠 Technological Stack

- **Backend**: Built entirely using Spring Boot, which offers a lightweight yet robust framework for developing scalable web applications.
- **Semantic Web**: Utilizes RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language) for structured, interconnected data representation.
- **SPARQL**: Querying language that allows for intelligent, flexible querying of the backend data, offering specific insights on plant species, habitats, and ecological changes.
- **Front-End**: Developed using React.js, ensuring a smooth, responsive user experience across devices.
- **REST API**: Facilitates efficient communication between the user interface and the backend, ensuring real-time data exchange.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Java 11 or higher
- Apache Maven
- Node.js and npm (for React front-end)

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/leaf-of-faith.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd leaf-of-faith/backend
    ```
3. Build the project using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```
4. Run the Spring Boot application:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```

### Front-End Setup (React.js)

1. Navigate to the front-end directory:
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Start the React application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Once both the back-end and front-end are running, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the platform.

## 🌐 How It Works

- The Semantic Web backend enables the storage of environmental data, modeling relationships between plant species, their habitats, and external factors.
- Users can perform SPARQL queries to extract precise information about endangered species or regions experiencing high deforestation rates.
- Conservationists can view reports, generate insights, and collaborate through the platform to make informed decisions in real time.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Conservation Impact**: Protect endangered flora in the Western Ghats by providing actionable insights.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Equip environmentalists with detailed, dynamic data for precise interventions.
- **Scalable Framework**: Ensure that the platform can grow to accommodate new data sources and more extensive datasets.

## 📖 Documentation

- **API Endpoints**: See the `API_DOC.md` file for detailed documentation of the REST API endpoints.
- **SPARQL Queries**: Example SPARQL queries and their usage can be found in the `QUERIES.md` file.
